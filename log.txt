Some weights of the model checkpoint at C:/PythonProject/mbart-large-50 were not used when initializing MBartModel: ['lm_head.weight', 'final_logits_bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing MBartModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing MBartModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
